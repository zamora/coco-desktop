# coco-desktop
This is a set of BASIC subroutines for the [Tandy Color Computer 3 (aka Coco 3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer#Color_Computer_3_(1986%E2%80%931991)) that provide a point-and-click user interface (based on the original Macintosh interface) that can be used in your own BASIC programs. It includes a sample program that uses the subroutines to make a Tic-Tac-Toe program with some extra goodies.

This was originally published (under the name Tony Zamora) in the March 1989 issue of The Rainbow (with a minor correction in the June 1989 issue).
